## About Me

üî¨ **Software Engineer & Data Scientist | Bioinformatics & Computational Biology Specialist** | üéì University of Toronto Alumnus

I'm passionate about building robust software solutions and leveraging data science, AI, and machine learning to tackle complex challenges, particularly within **cancer research and bioinformatics**. My experience spans the full software development lifecycle (SDLC), including DevOps/SRE practices, focusing on designing and deploying scalable, distributed systems and data-intensive applications primarily in **cloud environments (AWS)**.

Currently applying these skills as a Researcher at **Johns Hopkins University** and exploring new frontiers in AI and backend development at **Outlier**. I thrive on cross-functional collaboration, continuous learning, and am always seeking opportunities to innovate and contribute to impactful projects.

## üöÄ What I'm Currently Focused On

*   **Full-Stack Bioinformatics Software Engineering @ Johns Hopkins:** Architecting and developing open-source platforms, engineering large-scale (750TB+) ETL pipelines for multi-omics data, implementing ML models, and deploying cloud-native microservices (Python, R, JS, C, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform).
*   **Backend Software Development @ Outlier:** Optimizing AI-generated code, designing serverless functions, building/refactoring GraphQL/REST APIs, and contributing to monolith-to-microservices migrations (Python/FastAPI, Java/Spring Boot, AWS Lambda).
*   **Freelance Full-Stack Development:** Delivering custom web solutions and automation tools tailored to client needs.
