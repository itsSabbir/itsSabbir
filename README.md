## ‚óà About Me

As a passionate technologist and a University of Toronto High Honours graduate (B.Sc. Comp Sci & Bioinformatics, GPA 3.96), I operate at the intersection of **Data Engineering**, **Software Engineering**, and **Computational Biology**. My driving mission is to architect and deploy robust, data-centric solutions that tackle high-stakes challenges, with a deep-seated focus on advancing **cancer research**.

My career is defined by end-to-end ownership across the **full software development lifecycle (SDLC)**. I architect, build, and scale complex distributed systems, high-throughput data pipelines, and sophisticated web services, primarily within the **AWS cloud ecosystem**. I adhere to rigorous engineering standards, including **SOLID principles**, **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, and full-process automation via **CI/CD and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.

Currently, I engineer large-scale data solutions as a **Data Engineer at Bell**, while continuing my specialized research at **Johns Hopkins University**. I thrive in high-performing, cross-functional teams and am relentlessly committed to continuous learning and technical excellence.

## ‚óà Beyond The Keyboard

When I disconnect to recharge, you can find me:
*   Lost in the wizarding world of *Harry Potter* or debating the finer points of *The Office* and *Parks and Rec*.
*   Perfecting Biryani variations in the kitchen.
*   Following the discourse on sustainable technology and AI ethics.
*   Attempting to keep a houseplant alive (success rates are variable).
